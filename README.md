# FullStack App – Uptime Monitoring + SaaS Template

This is an event-driven microservices application using Pub/Sub for asynchronous communication between services.

The example in this starter is an **Uptime Monitoring System** that continuously monitors the uptime of a list of websites. When it detects a website is down, it posts a Slack message notifying that the website is down, and another message when the website is back up again.

The app also includes a **SaaS template** with authentication, RBAC, admin panel, and audit logging. Public routes (landing, pricing, signin, signup), protected user app (`/app`), and admin panel (`/admin`) are available.

It has a React frontend and you can try a demo version [here](https://uptime.encore.build/).

## Build from scratch with a tutorial

If you prefer, check out the [tutorial](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/tutorials/uptime) to learn how to build this application from scratch.

## Prerequisites 

**Install Encore:**
- **macOS:** `brew install encoredev/tap/encore`
- **Linux:** `curl -L https://encore.dev/install.sh | bash`
- **Windows:** `iwr https://encore.dev/install.ps1 | iex`
  
**Docker:**
1. Install [Docker](https://docker.com)
2. Start Docker

## Project structure

- **Public routes**: `/` (landing), `/pricing`, `/signin`, `/signup`, `/admin/signin`
- **User app** (requires sign-in): `/app` (uptime dashboard), `/app/settings`
- **Admin panel** (requires admin): `/admin`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/audit`

## Create app

Create a local app from this template:

```bash
encore app create uptime-example --example=ts/uptime
```

## Run app locally

Before running your application, make sure you have Docker installed and running. Build the frontend, then run Encore:

```bash
npm run build:frontend
npm run encore
```

Or use the full start command (generates client, builds frontend, runs Encore):

```bash
npm run start
```

The app runs on **port 4002** by default. To use the Slack integration, set the Slack Webhook URL (see tutorial above):

```bash
encore secret set --type local,dev,pr,prod SlackWebhookURL
```

**Optional environment variables** (for Encore + React Router integration):

- `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` – First signup with this email becomes admin (e.g. `admin@example.com`)
- `ENCORE_API_BASE_URL` – Override API base URL when hostname is invalid (e.g. production)
- `ENCORE_PUBLIC_HOST` – Override public host for request headers (default: `localhost:4002`)

**Note:** Cron Jobs do not execute when running locally.

## View the frontend

While `npm run encore` is running, head over to [http://localhost:4002/](http://localhost:4002/) to view the frontend. The landing page is at `/`; sign up or sign in to access the uptime monitoring dashboard at `/app`.

## Using the API

The API runs on port 4002 by default. Check if a given site is up (defaults to 'https://' if left out):

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:4002/ping/google.com'
```

Add a site to be automatically pinged every 1 hour:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:4002/site' -d '{"url":"google.com"}'
```

Check all tracked sites immediately:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4002/check-all'
```

Get the current status of all tracked sites:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:4002/status'
```

## Local Development Dashboard

While `npm run encore` is running, open [http://localhost:9400/](http://localhost:9400/) to access Encore's [local developer dashboard](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/observability/dev-dash).

Here you can see traces for all requests that you made while using the frontend, see your architecture diagram, and view API documentation in the Service Catalog.

## Connecting to databases

You can connect to your databases via psql shell:

```bash
encore db shell <database-name> --env=local --superuser
```

Learn more in the [CLI docs](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/cli/cli-reference#database-management).

## Deployment

### Self-hosting

See the [self-hosting instructions](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/self-host/build) for how to use `encore build docker` to create a Docker image and configure it.

### Encore Cloud Platform

Deploy your application to a free staging environment in Encore's development cloud using `git push encore`:

```bash
git add -A .
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push encore
```

You can also open your app in the [Cloud Dashboard](https://app.encore.dev) to integrate with GitHub, or connect your AWS/GCP account, enabling Encore to automatically handle cloud deployments for you.

## Link to GitHub

Follow these steps to link your app to GitHub:

1. Create a GitHub repo, commit and push the app.
2. Open your app in the [Cloud Dashboard](https://app.encore.dev).
3. Go to **Settings ➔ GitHub** and click on **Link app to GitHub** to link your app to GitHub and select the repo you just created.
4. To configure Encore to automatically trigger deploys when you push to a specific branch name, go to the **Overview** page for your intended environment. Click on **Settings** and then in the section **Branch Push** configure the **Branch name** and hit **Save**.
5. Commit and push a change to GitHub to trigger a deploy.

## Regenerating the API client

After changing auth or admin API response types, regenerate the Encore client:

```bash
npm run gen
```

## Testing

To run tests, configure the `test` command in your `package.json` to the test runner of your choice, and then use the command `encore test` from the CLI. The `encore test` command sets up all the necessary infrastructure in test mode before handing over to the test runner. [Learn more](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/develop/testing)

```bash
encore test
```
